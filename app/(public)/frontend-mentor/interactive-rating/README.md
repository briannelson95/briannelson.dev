## My process

I completed this solution much quicker than the previous. I decided to use TailwindCSS for all of the styling, making use of the [`tailwind.config.js`](https://github.com/briannelson95/briannelson.dev/blob/main/tailwind.config.js). I extended the theme to include the specific colors that were required in this challenge.
