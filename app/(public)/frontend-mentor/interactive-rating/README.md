## My process

This challenge was fairly easy for me as I have been working on a similar project in my freelance work. I chose not to hook any of the ratings up to a database to store. If this was something that I would like to store and see all the data for I would use [supabase](https://supabase.com). The use of tailwind has made the challenges easier to complete, as I only need to set the colors and font sizes in my [`tailwind.config.js`](https://github.com/briannelson95/briannelson.dev/blob/main/tailwind.config.js) and then I can call them as `classNames`.
